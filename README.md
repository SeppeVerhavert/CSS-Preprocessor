Learning to use CSS preprocessors


    Sass
      - Sass is completely compatible with all versions of CSS. 
      - Sass boasts more features and abilities than any other CSS extension language out there.
      - Sass has been actively supported for over 12 years by its loving Core Team. 
      - Over and over again, the industry is choosing Sass as the premier CSS extension language.
      - Sass is actively supported and developed by a consortium of several tech companies and hundreds of developers.
      - There are an endless number of frameworks built with Sass. Compass, Bourbon, and Susy just to name a few.
    
    
    LESS
      - Any value that is repeated – like colors or sizes, can use a variable.
      - Allows you to treat classes and ids as function which can be invoked inside of other classes and ids.
      - Less includes many types of functions that provide all kinds of functionality not available in standard CSS. 
      - Importing is a great feature of Less that allows you to break your CSS into smaller files and import them as needed. 
      - This allows @media to be nested inside of a class just like selectors can.
      - Less allows you to do so many more things with CSS that just isn’t possible with vanilla CSS and way more redundant typing.
    
    
    Stylus
      - Stylus has an extremely clean syntax.
      - Not only does Stylus support all the features from Less and Sass, it provides features not found anywhere else.
      - One of Stylus' distinguishing features is transparent mixins: reusuable, possibly dynamic styles that look exactly 
        like native CSS properties. 
      - @extend gives inheritance and unlike for other preprocessors, you can pass any CSS selector, not just classes.
      - Stylus runs on node.js which makes it very easy to integrate into your project if you're using npm.
      - Easier to learn than some of its competitors
    
    
    PostCSS
      - Transforms css with javascript
      - PostCSS Preset Env lets you convert modern CSS into something most browsers can understand, determining the polyfills 
        you need based on your targeted browsers or runtime environments, using cssdb.
      - CSS Modules (no worrying that names are too generic, just use whatever makes the most sense)
      - Enforce consistent conventions and avoid errors in your stylesheets with stylelint, a modern CSS linter.
      - LostGrid makes use of calc() to create stunning grids based on fractions without having to pass a lot of options.
